<p>As an Advanced Repair Agent with Geek Squad, I am required to diagnose and repair computer problems. I work with a
    small staff in our precinct and communicate regularly with clients to update them on work being performed on their
    computers. I ensure the validity of clients' records and file according to Best Buy's standard operating procedure.
    In addition, I handle the receiving and shipping of clients' products that are sent out to our service centers.</p>
